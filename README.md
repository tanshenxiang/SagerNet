## FAQ
**What is AppImage?** <br/>
  AppImage is a reliable and straightforward method for running applications on a Linux computer without the traditional installation process. You download a single, self-contained file which includes everything the program needs to operate. To use it, you simply grant the file permission to run and double-click it. This approach ensures compatibility across various Linux systems and allows for easy removal—simply delete the file when you no longer need the application, with no residual files left behind on your system.

  AppImage files for the [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) proxy program are available now in the GitHub Release page. Support for the AppImage format begins from version 5.6.10 onwards, offering Linux users an installation-free and portable way to run the application. There are download links within the assets section of the specific release pages starting from that version.

**Tun mode does not work for me.** <br/>
If [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) does not work in tun mode, then issue might be with tun configurations. Try to open tun settings, set stack to gvisor or set different tun address (for example, 168.19.0.1/24)

**I have computer with Windows 7, or Window 8, or Windows 8.1. Which version of [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) should I download?** <br/>
For Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1, it is recommended to first install [VxKex-NEXT](https://github.com/YuZhouRen86/VxKex-NEXT/releases) from the latest release available. After installing VxKex-NEXT, you should launch NekoBox using the VxVex mode to ensure proper functionality.

**I got the msvcp140.dll not found error on windows** <br/>
The "msvcp140.dll not found" error usually means that the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is missing or corrupted. To fix this, try install or reinstall the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable from the official Microsoft website
[Official Microsoft website for Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

**Does [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) really need to be run in UAC mode on Windows?** <br/>
No, that is not necessary. [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) restarts nekobox_core in UAC mode if TUN mode is selected and [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) is not already running with administrator privileges. [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) requests UAC confirmation to restart the core.

**Is setting the `SUID` bit really needed on Linux?** <br/>
No, it is not needed, but if `SUID` does not configured properly, the [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) will ask for administrator password to order to restart nekobox_core with administrator privilegies, if TUN mode is selected and [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) is not already running as root (or with special capabilities), [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) will ask for password for once, and will not configure `SUID`.

**Why does my internet stop working after I force quit [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox)?** <br/>
If [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) of version below that 5.10.41 is force-quit while `System proxy` is enabled, the process ends immediately and [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) cannot reset the proxy. <br/>
Solution for version < 5.10.40:
- Ensure that [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) closed manually.
- If you force quit by accident, open [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) again, enable `System proxy`, then disable it - this will reset the settings.
Solution for version >= 5.10.41:
- This won't happen, but if it does, please submit [issue](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox/issues).

**Why [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) uses Noto emoji instead of Twitter emoji? What differences between them two?** <br/>
  Noto Emoji is part of the Noto font family developed by Google. It aims for a clean, simple, and consistent design across various platforms, emphasizing legibility. It is often used in Android systems and Google services. Noto Emoji is designed to support a wide range of characters and symbols, making it suitable for diverse languages and scripts. Also, Noto Emoji is open source, which allows developers to use and modify it freely in their applications.

  Twitter Emoji, also known as Twemoji, has a more colorful and stylized design. It often features more expressive and characterful designs compared to Noto. These emojis are primarily used on Twitter and other platforms where Twitter’s branding is applied. They are designed for use in tweets, direct messages, and other Twitter communications. While Twemoji can be used elsewhere, it is specifically tailored for the Twitter platform, emphasizing a cohesive user experience within Twitter's ecosystem.

  Noto emoji provides better system integration and is part of the larger Noto fonts project, which aims to support all emoji characters defined in Unicode. Generally, Noto emoji are smaller than Twitter emoji. [NekoBox](https://github.com/qr243vbi/nekobox) does use Noto emoji font because we prefer better system integration over specific stylized design.
